## Installation

To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies as specified below:

```bash
pip3 install robotic unified-planning numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### High-Level Planning with PDDL

The high-level task planning module implements the table-cleaning task using PDDL. The steps to run the symbolic planner are as follows:

Steps:

1. Ensure the environment file task.g is in the specified path.
2. Run the PDDL planning code to generate a high-level plan for the task.

The planner will generate a sequential plan for pick-and-place operations and table cleaning based on the defined goals and initial state.

### Motion Planning with Bi-RRT, RRT*, PsBi-RRT
The low-level motion planning module implements Bi-RRT, RRT* and PsBi-RRT for path planning and trajectory execution. It ensures collision-free movements for pick-and-place tasks in a table-cleaning environment.

Steps:

1. Run the motion planning code.
2. The code integrates PPDL for sequential robotic manipulation and uses Bi-RRT, RRT* and PsBi-RRT to validate and refine the paths.

### Enviroment

Table Cleaning Enviroment is designed in task.g file.
